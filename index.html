            <h2 class="section-title">Our Mission Statement</h2>
            <div class="section-content">
                <p>The South African Pre-Payday Survival Bureau (SAPPSB) is a government-affiliated entity established to address the nationwide epidemic of "being broke until month-end" - a phenomenon affecting 87.3% of South Africans, excluding politicians and those who somehow benefit from load shedding.</p>

                <p>Our dedicated team of economists, behavioural psychologists, and part-time Uber drivers work around the clock (when Eskom permits) to provide evidence-based solutions for navigating the treacherous period between the 15th and 31st of each month. We specialise in advanced countdown mathematics, strategic two-minute noodle allocation, and optimising your relationship with the local spaza shop owner.</p>

                <p>Through cutting-edge calendar technology and our patented "Check Bank Balance Obsessively" methodology, we ensure that every South African knows exactly how many days remain until they can afford more than pap and wors. Our services are proudly load shedding resistant and available 24/7 (network coverage permitting).</p>

                <p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> This service does not account for unexpected municipal rate increases, petrol price hikes, or SARS audits. Results may vary during Eskom maintenance periods.</p>

                <p><strong>Load Shedding Resistant Technology:</strong> Our countdown timer runs on battery backup and solar power, ensuring continuous operation even during Stage 8 load shedding (should it ever happen, touch wood).</p>

                <p><strong>Multi-Language Support:</strong> Available in English, Afrikaans, and broken promises from Eskom. isiZulu version coming soon (pending budget approval from Treasury).</p>

                <p><strong>Local Currency Integration:</strong> All calculations done in Rand, accounting for weekly petrol price adjustments and the inevitable municipal rate increases that arrive like clockwork every July.</p>

                <p><strong>SARS Compliance:</strong> This website is fully compliant with all relevant tax legislation. No deductions apply to using this service, but SARS reserves the right to audit your desperation levels.</p>
