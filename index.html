            <h2 class="section-title">Our Mission Statement</h2>
            <div class="section-content">
                <p>The South African Pre-Payday Survival Bureau (SAPPSB) is a government-affiliated entity established to address the nationwide epidemic of "being broke until month-end" - a phenomenon affecting 87.3% of South Africans, excluding politicians and those who somehow benefit from load shedding.</p>

                <p>Our dedicated team of economists, behavioural psychologists, and part-time Uber drivers work around the clock (when Eskom permits) to provide evidence-based solutions for navigating the treacherous period between the 15th and 31st of each month. We specialise in advanced countdown mathematics, strategic two-minute noodle allocation, and optimising your relationship with the local spaza shop owner.</p>

                <p>Through cutting-edge calendar technology and our patented "Check Bank Balance Obsessively" methodology, we ensure that every South African knows exactly how many days remain until they can afford more than pap and wors. Our services are proudly load shedding resistant and available 24/7 (network coverage permitting).</p>

                <p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> This service does not account for unexpected municipal rate increases, petrol price hikes, or SARS audits. Results may vary during Eskom maintenance periods.</p>
